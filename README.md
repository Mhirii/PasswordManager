# Password Manager
Easy way to store, secure and access your accounts if you care about your privacy.
(*this project is still in it's early state*)

The set-up is fairly easy and simple, the program generates a key file (example.key) i highly recommend you store it somewhere safe and accessible.
you can add and load passwords to/from a password file (example.pass) the encryption key is thus needed to encrypt/decript the passwords respectively.
